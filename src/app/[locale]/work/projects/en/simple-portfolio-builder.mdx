My design and embroidery work draws deep inspiration from the rich cultural and architectural tapestry of Lahore and Multan. The ornate facades, vivid colors, and layered histories of sites like Lahore's Heera Mandi (the historic red-light district), Shahi Hammam, and the richly adorned gurdwaras reflect in the motifs and textures I incorporate into my work. The stories embedded in these places – from the vibrant courtyards of ancient inns to the spiritual calm of gurdwaras – shape the visual narrative that defines my artistic approach.

Heera Mandi, in particular, fascinates me with its intricate balconies, colonial-era windows, and the echoes of classical music and dance that once defined the area. This district's resilience and complex beauty spark creative exploration, inspiring designs that merge past opulence with modern interpretation. Likewise, the vivid frescoes and gold leaf work in gurdwaras influence the embroidery patterns I stitch, blending spiritual symbols with contemporary aesthetics.

Above, you'll find a selection of my photography, capturing the essence of these vibrant streets and sacred spaces. Through the lens, I focus on the textures, doorways, and architectural flourishes that breathe life into these historic neighborhoods. This visual documentation is integral to my art, grounding my designs in the authenticity of Lahore and Multan's diverse heritage.
